# CRUD MERN Challenge

This is a project that started as a code challenge, and I've added to it for experimentation, and some other challenges. The app, for now, is a create-react-app with an express backend and mongodb database.

---

### Game Schedule Challenge

This challenge required aggregating and serving a game schedule grouping by month. The front end route is: `http://localhost:3002/game-schedule`

There is only one api route for this challange and is located at `http://localhost:5000/api/schedule`

---

## Building and running

The app will build, seed database, and run using docker.

From the root directory, run:

```
docker-compose up
```
